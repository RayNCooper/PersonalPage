Hi, I'm Dennis. I'm a fullstack developer holding a bachelor's degree in Information Systems. Since I started programming at a young age, my goal has been to write reliable and comprehensive software.


I am an Open Source enthusiast and as such want to build platforms that empower and liberate both users and developers. 

I believe that businesses building on free software or an open core model contribute to a more fair economic system.
